Bug reports must include the following information:

1. natsio version (is this a recent version?)
2. output of `rustc --version` (we support Rust 1.37 and up)
3. your operating system
4. code that behaved in an unexpected way
  ```rust
  // code goes here
  ```
5. what did you expect? what happened instead?

Thank you for helping us to understand your issue.
